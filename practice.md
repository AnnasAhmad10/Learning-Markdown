RAG, or **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, is a hybrid approach in natural language processing (NLP) that combines the strengths of **retrieval-based** methods and **generative models** to improve the quality of generated text. It is commonly used in tasks like question answering, information retrieval, and dialogue systems.

### Components of RAG:

1. **Retrieval-Based**:
   - This component retrieves relevant information or documents from a large database or knowledge base.
   
2. **Generative Model**:
   - After retrieving relevant information, the generative model, typically based on architectures like **GPT** or **BERT**, generates a coherent and context-aware response based on both the retrieved content and the original input.
